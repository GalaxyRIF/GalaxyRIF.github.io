Education
======
* M.Sci. in Mathematics, Imperial College London, 2024
* B.Sc. in Mathematics, Imperial College London, 2023

Research Experience
======
* Spring 2022: Group research on Homogenisation problems
  * Supervisor: Dr. Arianna Giunti, Imperial College London
  * Key words: homogenisation problem, numerical simulation
  * [Project report](/assets/M2R_Homogenisation.pdf)
  * [Project Github](https://github.com/Desmond-LIN-Y/Homogenization)

  We worked in a group of six people and studied the theory of homogenisation. 
  Detaile topic include:
    * 1-D homogenisation: full proof of existence and uniqueness of 1-D peridoic case, and sketch proof of 1-D stochastic case.
    * N-D homogenisation: sketech proof
    * Numerical verification: two people were responsible for the numerical simulation of the homogenisation in Python. Desmond Lin used Iterative Stencil Loop Method, and I used Relaxation method. Both methods were applied to both 2-D stochastic and 2-D periodic(layered) cases.

* Winter 2021: Impvis project
  * Supervisor:  Dr. Jonathan Rackham and Dr. Paul Franklyn, Department of Materials, Imperial College.

  * This is a group project where students from different department collaborated to design interactive visualisation of certain concepts. We focused on the concept of X-ray diffraction, and the work was split into several parts. 
  * I was responsible for the visualisation of Ewald's sphere, which is a concept created to exaplain the how change in wavelength of the light interact with the lattice points. 
  * More information and the interative visualisations available at [Impvis Wiki](https://wiki.impvis.co.uk/index.php?title=X-ray_diffraction).
